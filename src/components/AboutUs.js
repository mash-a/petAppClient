    return <div className="container"><p>Founded in 2010, by Rachel Bowers, Brooklyn Bark has been raising the bar for pet care. Rachel worked with many types of animals, including parrots, rabbits, guinea pigs, rats, hamsters, snakes, wild life and of course dogs and cats. Before founding Brooklyn Bark, Rachel worked as a pet care professional while freelancing in graphic art.
    Growing up with a rescue dog, she learned the importance of animal trust and routine. When the family went of vacation and boarded their dog at a kennel, she experienced PTSD/ shelter shock. At the time this was not acknowledged in the animal community as being a "real thing", but a traumatized dog who bloodied her paws trying to escape told the truth. This led to the foundation of Brooklyn Bark.  Animals can become stressed when their family, routine and environment change.
